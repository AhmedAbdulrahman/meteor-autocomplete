meteor-autocomplete
===================

Prefix auto-completion using documents and fields in local Meteor collections.

## What's this do?

## Usage

```
{
    token: '@'
    collection: Foo
    field: "name"
}
```

### Credits/Notes

- If you are not using Meteor, you may want to check out [jquery sew](https://github.com/tactivos/jquery-sew), from which this was heavily modified.
- If you need tag autocompletion only (and no symbols), try either the [x-editable smart package](https://github.com/nate-strauser/meteor-x-editable-bootstrap) with Select2 or [jquery-tokenInput](http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/).
